# My Portfolio Website

## Tuesday, 14 August 2018

Building this website provided me with some great web development experience, and allowed me to experiment with some front end frameworks - eventually setting on Vue.js. The backend data is currently held in Google Firebase.

### Future Updates

The next step is likely going to be adding [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/). Nuxt.js allows server-side rendering which will improve Search Engine Optimisation and better sharing on Social Media!
