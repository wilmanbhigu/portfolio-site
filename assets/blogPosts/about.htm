        Hi, I'm Andrew Robilliard. Originally from Canada, I've now been in New
        Zealand for a lot longer than seems possible. Currently, I'm in my
        final year of a Bachelor of Science at the
        <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/" target="_blank">University of Auckland</a>,
        majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Jan. 2018, I am excited to be starting as a Graduate Developer
        at
        <a href="https://www.intergen.co.nz/" target="_blank">Intergen</a>.
      </p>

        When I'm not buried in assignments, you can often find me trying to
        learn something I've managed to find on the Internet. Who knows, it
        might be helpful one day! After a few technical assessments on
        <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/andrewrobilliard" target="_blank">HackerRank</a>,
        I became pretty enamoured with using it to touch up on my Java and
        SQL skills. I also consider myself to be a bit of a movie buff, so if
        I'm missing during film festival season, you know why. When I get tired
        of being indoors, I might be out running, or maybe even snowboarding at
        Mt. Ruapehu if I've managed to drag someone along.

        So, why did I choose technology? I took Computer Science throughout
        high school, starting right from year 9. However, in those early years,
        I have to admit it wasn't that exciting. Building basic programs in
        Scratch and writing some HTML just wasn't challenging for me, and I
        always preferred pulling out a calculator to a keyboard. It wasn't
        until year 12 when I entered the
        <a href="http://mashup.nz" target="_blank">Bay of Plenty Mashup</a>
        competition that I realised my passion for IT. This event was my first
        experience with business analysis, stakeholder elicitation, and an
        array of other ideas that would later become an integral part of my
        Information Systems major. That weekend opened my eyes and allowed me
        to realise the extent to which technology can be implemented to
        complete real, meaningful problems and it was a turning
        point for me. Luckily,
        <a href="http://php.mmc.school.nz/archived/2015/mashup/victorioussecrets/" target="_blank">
          that project</a> managed to be archived on my high school server
          before I left for university. It's interesting for me to look back on
          and see where my journey started.
        </p>

          So that was high school, what's happened since I got to university?
          Course work has kept me pretty busy, and coding that I do is often
          either directly related to an assignment or written to enhance my
          knowledge of a class. Examples of each are held on my
          <a href="https://github.com/ALRobilliard/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
          which I'm currently using as a bit of a glorified portfolio. Apart
          from this code, which is primarily written in Java, you can also find
          a few business documents produced as part of Information Systems.
          This variety of tasks was something I've enjoyed while at
          university, and I think it allowed me to obtain a good balance between
          technical CS skills and more communication-oriented business ones.
          Within my majors, I've chosen courses to tailor my skills and define
          myself from the pack. These include:
          <ul>
            <li>Networking - TCP/IP Stack</li>
            <li>Java and Python Programming</li>
            <li>SQL and T-SQL</li>
            <li>Database Management - Particularly Data Warehousing</li>
            <li>Data Science and Data Analytics</li>
            <li>Computer Graphics and Image Processing</li>
          </ul>
