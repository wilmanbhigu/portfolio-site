				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					Stereotypical Canadian // Pun Lover // BSc in CompSci and InfoSys
					at UoA
				</p>
				<p>
					I am currently a hardworking, persistent, and adaptive tertiary
					student at the University of Auckland, studying a Bachelor of Science
					majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have always had an interest in computer science, and that interest
					only grew as I became older and passed through high school. Having
					consistently high grades in high school computer science, it pushed
					me towards the career I am still actively seeking following my
					graduation at the University of Auckland. Ideally I am interested in
					a future career relating to systems and networks, as large scale data
					manipulation and analysis in problem solving is where my true passion
					and interest lies.
