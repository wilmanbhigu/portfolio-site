					</div>
					<p>
						Hi, I'm Andrew Robilliard. Originally from Canada, I've now been in New
						Zealand for a lot longer than seems possible. Currently, I'm in my
						final year of a Bachelor of Science at the
						<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/" target="_blank">University of Auckland</a>,
						majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						From Jan. 2018, I am excited to be starting as a Graduate Developer
						at
						<a href="https://www.intergen.co.nz/" target="_blank">Intergen</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I'm not buried in assignments, you can often find me trying to
						learn something I've managed to find on the Internet. Who knows, it
						might be helpful one day! After a few technical assessments on
						<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/andrewrobilliard" target="_blank">HackerRank</a>,
						I became pretty enamoured with using it to touch up on my Java and
						SQL skills. I also consider myself to be a bit of a movie buff, so if
						I'm missing during film festival season, you know why. When I get tired
						of being indoors, I might be out running, or maybe even snowboarding at
						Mt. Ruapehu if I've managed to drag someone along.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, why did I choose technology? I took Computer Science throughout
						high school, starting right from year 9. However, in those early years,
						I have to admit it wasn't that exciting. Building basic programs in
						Scratch and writing some HTML just wasn't challenging for me, and I
						always preferred pulling out a calculator to a keyboard. It wasn't
						until year 12 when I entered the
						<a href="http://mashup.nz" target="_blank">Bay of Plenty Mashup</a>
						competition that I realised my passion for IT. This event was my first
						experience with business analysis, stakeholder elicitation, and an
						array of other ideas that would later become an integral part of my
						Information Systems major. That weekend opened my eyes and allowed me
						to realise the extent to which technology can be implemented to
						complete real, meaningful problems and it was a turning
						point for me. Luckily,
						<a href="http://php.mmc.school.nz/archived/2015/mashup/victorioussecrets/" target="_blank">
						that project</a> managed to be archived on my high school server
						before I left for university. It's interesting for me to look back on
						and see where my journey started.
					</p>
					<p>
						So that was high school, what's happened since I got to university?
						Course work has kept me pretty busy, and coding that I do is often
						either directly related to an assignment or written to enhance my
						knowledge of a class. Examples of each are held on my
						<a href="https://github.com/ALRobilliard/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
						which I'm currently using as a bit of a glorified portfolio. Apart
						from this code, which is primarily written in Java, you can also find
						a few business documents produced as part of Information Systems.
						This variety of tasks was something I've enjoyed while at
						university, and I think it allowed me to obtain a good balance between
						technical CS skills and more communication-oriented business ones.
						Within my majors, I've chosen courses to tailor my skills and define
						myself from the pack. These include:
						<ul>
							<li>Networking - TCP/IP Stack</li>
							<li>Java and Python Programming</li>
							<li>SQL and T-SQL</li>
							<li>Database Management - Particularly Data Warehousing</li>
							<li>Data Science and Data Analytics</li>
							<li>Computer Graphics and Image Processing</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>January 28, 2018</h3>

						<p>Grads after a very tiring first day.</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						Seeing as I’m one week into my first proper job of my career, with
						my first day at the office coming up in less than two days, I
						thought it was a perfect time to start getting some writing on my
						website. I’m hoping to get out weekly or fortnightly updates as I
						begin my employment with
						<a href="https://www.intergen.co.nz/" target="_blank">Intergen</a>
						at their Auckland office to try
						and document my learning and maybe even help or reassure others
						moving into a developer career. So, without further ado, here’s how
						my first week went for the New Zealand leaders in the design and
						application of Microsoft technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’d be lying if I didn’t admit I was very nervous to start this
						week. New experiences are intimidating enough without the need to
						fly across the country for a week to meet the team at the head
						office. Pair that with being pushed into a conference room full
						of all the other grads I’ve never met, and you’ve got a recipe for
						shyness. Little did we know how close we’d become by the end of the
						week.
					</p>
					<p>
						Day one started with an introductory chat about our
						<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank"> Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>
						(MBTI). At the time it seemed like a general chat
						about how to work as a team despite personality differences, but it
						certainly ended up setting up the foundation for the week. Following
						this, we had a few more talks about company values, which again
						became very important later in the week, finished off with quite a
						personal chat with the CEO of Intergen, Simon Bright. For us to have
						an extended meeting with Simon on the first day was a bit daunting,
						but this was overshadowed by just how refreshing it was to see
					  upper management show such genuine interest in the graduates his
						company had brought on.
					</p>
					<p>
						Soon after this meeting, we headed off to
						<a href="http://www.makahika.co.nz/" target="_blank">Makahika Outdoor Pursuit</a>
						Centre in the Tararua Ranges which was the setting for the rest of
						the week. Makahika presented the graduates with numerous challenges
						throughout the week, as well as ample opportunities for reflecting
						upon self-learning and team interaction. Virtually everything we
						did was completed for this development, and it was incredibly
						impressive to see the progress made by the group throughout the
						week. We were undoubtedly more talkative at the end of the day one,
						but by the time it was time to leave I wouldn’t even recognise the
						shy, timid people that arrived on that day.
					</p>
					<p>
						During our time at Makahika, one activity, in particular, stood out
						to me for a variety of reasons. One of which may lead us to be a
						talking point for the next group of grads to pass through. Each
						morning, our predefined team (Go Team Interlock!) had to transport
						twenty-five litres of water, two large wooden poles, and two large
						plastic bins full of assorted items for 20 mins off of the property.
						Once travelling the twenty minutes, we had to take a team photo and
						return to the starting point with all the gear.
					</p>
					<p>
						Initially, it seemed a mundane task to get us energised and ready
						for the day, but it turned out to be a valuable test for many
						talking points throughout the week. Team communication, elicitation
						of requirements, and willingness to retrace your steps and disregard
						progress were all necessary for the task. Our team displayed
						measurable improvement in the first two points throughout the week.
						Unfortunately, on day two we had a bit of slip-up with point three
						on the second day of the challenge. After carrying the heavy gear
						up quite a steep incline for the better part of twenty minutes, a
						lot of us were quite keen to explore what we thought was a looping
						track on the way back. Not only would it give us a bit of variety
						in the walk, but we could also ignore the feeling of lost progress
						as we retraced our steps. It was indeed a loop track, but
						unfortunately was 10 kilometres long - not something to be done in
						twenty minutes. After an extra forty-five minutes of walking with
						no end in sight, it was time to turn around for fear of getting
						even more lost than we already were. I don’t think we were prepared
						to learn such a long lesson of retracing past knowledge, but we got
						it that day. By the time got back, everyone was exhausted, yet still
						committed to teamwork and our little alliance. This positivity was
						something that I thought was awesome and displayed the group dynamic
						that we had formed. As we discussed in our reflection on the task,
						teamwork may have gotten us into that mess, but it also got us out.
						It was a tiring lesson, but something that proved invaluable to our
						learning and even our closeness as a team.
					</p>
					<p>
						Travelling home from my week in Wellington and the Manawatu was a
						very different experience that I had felt on the way there. The
						goodbyes to grads not working in Auckland were hard, even if I could
						Skype them at work if I wanted. I certainly have a lot of new
						Facebook friends after the week so we can stay in contact, but the
						real thing that we had for that brief amount of time was even
						better. I’m looking forward to my time with Intergen, and I can’t
						wait to start on Tuesday.
