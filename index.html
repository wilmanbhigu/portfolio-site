				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					Hi I'm Andrew Robilliard. Originally from Canada, I've now been in New
					Zealand for a lot longer than seems possible. Currently I'm in my
					final year of a Bachelor of Science at the
					<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/" target="_blank">University of Auckland</a>,
					majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not buried in assignments you can often find me trying to
					learn something I've managed to find on the Internet. Who knows, it
					might be helpful one day! After a few technical assessments on
					<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/robilliardnz" target="_blank">HackerRank</a>,
					I became pretty enamoured with using it to touch up on my Java and
					SQL skills. I also consider myself to be a bit of a movie buff, so if
					I'm missing during film festival season you know why. When I get tired
					of being indoors I might be out running, or maybe even snowboarding at
					Mt. Ruapehu if I've managed to drag someone along.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, why did I choose technology? I took Computer Science throughout
					high school, starting right from year 9. However, in those early years
					I have to admit it wasn't that exciting. Building basic programs in
					Scratch and writing some HTML just wasn't challenging for me, and I
					always preferred pulling out a calculator to a keyboard. It wasn't
					until year 12 when I entered the
					<a href="http://www.mashup.nz" target="_blank">Bay of Plenty Mashup</a>
					competition that I realised my passion for IT. This event was my first
					experience with business analysis, stakeholder illicitation, and an
					array of other ideas that would later become an integral part of my
					Information Systems major. That weekend opened my eyes and allowed me
					to realise the extent to which technology can be implemented to
					complete real, meaningful problems and it was definitely a turning
					point for me. Luckily,
					<a href="http://php.mmc.school.nz/archived/2015/mashup/victorioussecrets/" target="_blank">
					that project</a> managed to be archived on my high school server
					before I left for university. It's interesting for me to look back on
					and see where my journey started.
				</p>
				<p>
					So that was high school, what's happened since I got to university?
					Course work has kept me pretty busy, and coding that I do is often
					either directly related to an assignment or written to enhance my
					knowledge of a class. Examples of each are held on my
					<a href="https://github.com/ALRobilliard/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
					which I'm currently using as a bit of a glorified portfolio. Apart
					from this code, which is primarily written in Java, you can also find
					a few business documents produced as part of Information Systems.
					This variety of tasks was something I've really enjoyed while at
					university, and I think it allowed me to obtain a good balance between
					technical CS skills and more communication-oriented business ones.
					Within my majors I've chosen courses to tailor my skills and define
					myself from the pack. These include:
					<ul>
						<li>Networking - TCP/IP Stack</li>
						<li>Java and Python Programming</li>
						<li>SQL and T-SQL</li>
						<li>Database Management - Particularly Data Warehousing</li>
						<li>Data Science and Data Analytics</li>
						<li>Computer Graphics and Image Processing</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that my time at university is coming to an end, I'm looking
					for graduate opportunities starting at the end of 2017/beginning of
					2018. Please have a look at my
					<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ajuvrw96jkqirza/Andrew%20Robilliard%20CV.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">
					résumé</a> and
					<a href="mailto:andrew_robilliard@outlook.com?Subject=Resume%20Enquiry" target="_top">
					get in touch</a>
					if you know of any roles that might suit me.
